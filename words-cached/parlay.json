C. Battisti and G. Alessio ({it}Dizionario etimologico italiano,{/it} Florence, 1954) characterize {it}parolo{/it} as Neapolitan (\"voce napoletano\") and adduce additionally Sicilian {it}pàrula{/it} \"doppia posta nel giuoco del faraone o bassetta\" (\"double stake in the game of faro or basset [a game similar to faro]\"), which they aver to be a derivative of {it}paro{/it} \"equal.\" Opposing these conjectures is the entry {it}párolo{/it} in a list of dialect words from Lucca in Tuscany, along with their etymologies, compiled by Silvio Pieri (\"Appunti etimologici,\" {it}Zeitschrift für romanische Philologie,{/it} Band 30 [1903], p. 302). Pieri proposes that the word is a univerbation of {it}paro lo{/it} \"I offer it (hold it out),\" referring to the sum wagered.
