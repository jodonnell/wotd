Of the instances of the word in the {it}Iliad{/it} and {it}Odyssey{/it} (usually in the plural {it}phrénes{/it}) that do not unambiguously refer to mental faculties, the consensus has been since the Homeric scholiasts that the word refers to the midriff and more specifically to the diaphragm. But occurrences in the {it}Iliad{/it} such as the following passage (XVI, 503-04) would appear to indicate otherwise: \"ho dè làx en stḗthesi baínōn / ek chroòs hélke dóru, protì dè phrénes autôi héponto\" (\"… and Patroklos stepping heel braced to chest dragged / the spear out of his [the Lycian hero Sarpedon's] body, and the midriff came away with it\"—Richmond Lattimore translation). The {it}phrénes{/it} that come out with the spear cannot reasonably refer to the entire midsection of Sarpedon's torso, nor does it seem likely that the diaphragm—mostly a thin sheet of tissue between the lungs and abdominal organs—would be pulled out either. (For detailed discussion of Greek usage see S. Ireland and F. L. D. Steel, \"Greek {it}φρένες{/it} as an anatomical Organ in the Works of Homer,\" {it}Glotta,{/it} 53. Band, Heft 3/4 [1975], pp. 183-95.) Though ablaut variants of {it}phrḗn{/it} have a rich derivational history in Greek, the word has no sure Indo-European etymology. A connection with Old Icelandic {it}grunr{/it} \"suspicion,\" {it}gruna, grunda{/it} \"to suspect\" (presumed Indo-European {it}*g{sup}wh{/sup}ren-{/it}?, with no other Germanic congeners) is doubtful at best. The formation of {it}phrḗn{/it} is paralleled by several other body part words, as {it}adḗn{/it} \"gland\" (see {et_link|adeno-|adeno-}), {it}auchḗn{/it} \"neck, throat,\" {it}splḗn{/it} \"spleen\" (see {et_link|spleen|spleen})."]]]],"date":"circa 1529","shortdef":["marked by fast and energetic, disordered, or anxiety-driven activity : frenzied, frantic"]},{"meta":{"id":"phrenetic","uuid":"a28fe335-54f7-40dd-8c21-750b49850469","sort":"160268700","src":"collegiate","section":"alpha","stems":["frenetic","phrenetic"],"offensive":false},"hwi":{"hw":"phre*net*ic"},"cxs":[{"cxl":"archaic spelling of","cxtis":[{"cxt":"frenetic"}]}],"shortdef":[]}]
