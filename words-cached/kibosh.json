The recent theories to which he alludes see the following as sources for {it}kibosh{/it}: the heraldic term {it}caboched, caboshed{/it} \"(of an animal's head) borne full-face without the neck showing\"; {it}kibosh{/it} as a term for an iron bar used by clogmakers in the north of England (apparently first attested in 1860); Arabic {it}kurbāj, kirbāj {/it} \"whip, lash\" and its source, Turkish {it}kırbaç.{/it} The latter hypothesis is argued at length in a monograph by Gerald Cohen, Stephen Goranson and Matthew Little, {it}Origin of Kibosh{/it} (Routledge, 2017), which also summarizes recently found antedatings to citations of the word in the {it}Oxford English Dictionary{/it} (dating the word with certainty to 1834, and perhaps to 1830). Pace the authors' enthusiasm, the Arabic/Turkish origin is questionable: if Charles Dickens' 1835 recording of the word as \"kye-bosh\" accurately reflects the vowel and accent of the first syllable (according with the current pronunciation), the phonetic gap between the source and the English word is difficult to bridge; and the authors suggest no mechanism by which an assumed loanword from the eastern Mediterranean could have found its way into the speech of lower London social strata. Liberman may well be correct that \"with the present evidence at our disposal, the chance of unearthing the origin of {it}kibosh{/it} is vanishingly small.\""]]]],"date":"1830","shortdef":["something that serves as a check or stop —usually used in the phrase put the kibosh on"]},{"meta":{"id":"kybosh","uuid":"5285bedb-2343-4925-9fb0-90c0dce1deb8","sort":"110087900","src":"collegiate","section":"alpha","stems":["kibosh","kybosh","kyboshed","kyboshes","kyboshing"],"offensive":false},"hwi":{"hw":"ky*bosh"},"cxs":[{"cxl":"chiefly British spelling of","cxtis":[{"cxt":"kibosh"}]}],"shortdef":[]},{"meta":{"id":"put the kibosh on","uuid":"ebf096c6-8b24-49b1-94df-775f106b6e69","sort":"3015720000","src":"ld","section":"idioms","stems":["put the kibosh on","puts the kibosh on","putting the kibosh on"],"offensive":false},"hwi":{"hw":"put the kibosh on"},"fl":"idiom","def":[{"sls":["informal"],"sseq":[[["sense",{"dt":[["text","{bc}to stop or end (something) {bc}to prevent (something) from happening or continuing "],["vis",[{"t":"His mother {it}put the kibosh on{/it} his smoking habit."}]]]}]]]}],"shortdef":["to stop or end (something) : to prevent (something) from happening or continuing"]}]
